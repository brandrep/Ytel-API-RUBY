## How to contribute to the Ytel API SDK

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in the Ytel API**, and instead email support@ytel.com.  We will be starting up a security bounty account on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/) Shortly.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mgrofsky/Ytel-API-RUBY/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mgrofsky/Ytel-API-RUBY/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* Issue Template:
  * Description of the issue.
  * How can we replicate the issue?
  * File in the repo involved if known
  * Where you able to resolve the issue by making modifications?  If so, how?

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#reporting-an-issue).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the Ytel API will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Ytel Support System](https://support.ytel.com) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the Ytel API in the [Ytel API Portal](https://portal.message360.com).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Ytel API documentation?**

* sign up for a [ReadMe.io](http://www.readme.io) account and you can submit suggestions, changes and edits in the same way merge requests are done in Github.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you for the Ruby on Rails team for providing an easy contribution template that I was able to utilize.

Thanks.
